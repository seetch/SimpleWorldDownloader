- BlockEntities
- Resourcepacks
- Player Inventory
- Entities
- Enderchest Inventory
- Containers (Chests, Barrels, ...)
- Villagers
- Advancements

Download on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-world-downloader), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-world-downloader) or [Github](https://github.com/J0KER2J0KER/SimpleWorldDownloader/releases/latest).

# Containers
Container inventories (Enderchest, Chests, Barrels, ...) can only be saved if you open the inventory at least once while the world download is running. This is also true for Entitiy Inventories (like Villagers, Chestboats, Horses, ...).

# Advancements & Statistics
Advancements and Statistics can only be saved if the corresponding UI's are opened at least once while the download is running.

# Fabric API
The Fabric API is required for this Mod to work. It can be downloaded [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).

# Building
Run `./gradlew buildAllVersions` to build the Minecraft 1.21.11 and 26.2 releases together.
The finished JAR files are copied to `build/versions`.

# Config
Use "/swd config" to access the config.

### Chunk Map
Press `U` to open the chunk map. Green chunks are saved, yellow chunks are queued, blue chunks are loaded by the client, and gray chunks have not been loaded yet. Drag to move the map and use the mouse wheel to zoom.

The key can be changed in Minecraft's key bindings. Mod Menu also provides buttons for the chunk map and key binding settings in the mod config screen.

### Auto Downloading
Set whether worlds should be downloaded automatically on server joining.

### Save world to
Set the name of the saved world. If a world with this name already exists, the new chunks overwrite parts of that world.
